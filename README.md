# How to
Open an account on https://openai.com.
Create an API Key and copy it.
Export it to you Environment. Maybe something like:
  export OPENAI_API_KEY=SomeLongStringOfLongCharactersAndNumb3r5

Open a Google Cloud Developer account. You should have one already, if not, bad player no cookie.  Seriously I think
it's still free for 1 year. Some services like Google APIs into Speech will cost a tiny fee.

Go to your console and create a new App for Text2Speech and connect it to their Speech API.
Get the API Key (don't forget to enable the service so you can connect)
put it in a file in your project directory called google_secret_key.json or whereever you want and
modify the code accordingly. You could even stick it in your ENVironment vars as I've done for OpenAI.

Check the code and make sure things look right. If you are a penetration tester you should never blindly
download and run code ;)
